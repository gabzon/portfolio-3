Questions are the new answers

"He who asks questions cannot avoid the answers" - Cameroon Proverb

It is said, that if you ask you shall receive.

You've learned how our believes affect our decisions, our actions, the directions of our lives, and therefore our ultimate destiny. But all these influences are a product of thinking...

To get to the bottom of how we create our reality on a daily basis we need to answer the question. "just how do we think?"

Our questions determine our thoughts

What really makes the biggest difference in my life, in who I become, in who I am as a person, and in where I am going?

It is not the events that shape my life that determine how I feel and act, but, rather it's the way I interpret and evaluate my life experiences, The meaning I attach to an event will determine the decisions I make, the actions I take, and therefore my ultimate destiny"

How do I go about evaluating?
What is an evaluation?
Right now I'm evaluating, aren't I?
What am I doing right now?

Thinking itself is nothing but the process of asking and answering questions.

If we want to change the quality of our lives, we have to change our habitual questions.

Questions direct our focus, and therefore how we think and how we feel.

The main difference between the people who seemed to be successful-in any area!- and those who weren't was that successful people asked better questions and as a result, they got better answers. They got answers that empowered them to know exactly what to do in any situation to produce the results they desired.

Quality questions create quality life.

Questions set off a processional effect that has an important impact beyond our imaginations. Questionning our limitations is what tears down the walls in life-in business, in relationships, between countries. I believe all human progress is preceded by new questions.

The power of questions
"Some men see things as they are, and say, Why?, I dream of things that never were, and say, Why not?"-George bernard shaw

"Always the beautiful answer who ask a more beautiful question" - E.E. Cummings

The difference between people is the difference in the questions they ask consistently

Could a person change how they feel in a moment? you bet- just by changing their focus. How do you change the focus? ask questions

Remember, ask and you shall receive. If you ask a terrible question you'll get a terrible answer. Your mental computer is ever ready to serve you, and whatever question you give it, it will surely come up with an answer.

Usually when something bad happens people tend to ask questions like this:
Why me? How could god do this to me? Why is life so unfair?
What's the use of living as "cripple"?

Instead of asking empowering questions like:

How can I use this in my advantage?
Because of this, what will I be able to contribute to others?
What do I still have? Who am I really? Am I really only my body, or am I something more? what am I capable of now? even more so than before?
How can I get a date with her?
How did I get so luck in my life?
What do I love the most about he or hers(husband or wife)?
How can I get rich while everybody is afraid?

Remember it's not the quesitons you ask, but the questions you fail to ask, that shape your destiny

"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity. of life, of the marvellous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity" -Albert Einstein

What power could you unleash by asking some equally simple but powerful questions?

Question are undeniably a magic tool that allows the genie in our minds to meet our wishes; tehy are the wake up call to giant capacities. They allow us to achieve our desires if only we present them in the form of a specific and well-thought-out request. A genuine quality of life comes from consistent, quality questions. Remember your brain, like the genie, will give you whatever you ask of it. So be careful what you ask for-whatever you look for you'll find.

Example when you are going to eat and you want to lose weight, instead of saying, what do I prefer, what do I like most, etc. You should ask:
What's something light that I can eat that would give me energy? What would really nourish me the most? Will this cleanse me or clog me?
What's the ultimate price I'll pay if I don't stop this indulgence now?
If I eat this, what will I have to give up in order to still achieve my goals?
Ask the questions that will uplift your spirit and push you along the path of human excellence.

How questions work

1.Questions immediately change what we're focusing on and therefore how we feel.
If you keep focusing on questions like "how come I'm so depressed?" or "Why doesn't anyone like me?" You will focus on, look for, and find references to back up the idea that there is a reason for you to feel depressed and unlove. Instead you ask "How can I change my state so that I am feeling happy and am being more loveable?"
This question will focus on solutions, so problems.

What am I happy about now?
what could I be happy about if I wanted to be?
How would that make me feel?

You and I can change how we feel in an instant, just by changing our focus

What are my most treasured memories?
What's really great in my life right now?

If I don't change this, what is the ultimate price?
What will this cost me in the long run?
How will my whole life be transformed if I did this right now?

Create a new, empowering alternative with a set of better questions and then condition them by rehearsing them until they become a consistent part of your life.

A skill of power

Learning to ask empowering questions in moments of crises is a critical skill

Model the habitual questions of people I really respect.

When something bad happens ask to yourself:
What can I learn from this situation?
How can I use this situation in my advantage?

Ask yourself some emopowering questions right now:
What are you truly happy about in your life right now?
What's really great in your life today?
What are you truly greateful for?

2. Question change what we delete

Questions are the laser of human consciousness. They concentrate our focus and determine what we feel and do.

How can I learn from this problem so that it never happens again?

THE POWER OF PRESUPPOSITON

Questions affect our beliefs and what we consider possible or impossible

Presupposition program us to accept things that may or may not be true. They can be used on us by other or even subconsciously by ourselves.

If you ask someone why do I always sobotage myself? after something ends disappointingly, you set yourself up for more of the same and set in motion a self-fulfilling prophecy, why?

3. Questions change the resources available us
How can I turn this around?

You and I have that same power at our disposal every moment of the day. At any moment, the questions that we ask ourselves can shape our perception of who we are, what we're capable of, and what we're willling to do to achieve our dreams.

Becareful not to ask limiting question or you'll receive limited answers

PROBLEM SOLVING QUESTIONS
The key then is to develop a pattern of consistent questions that empower you

The problem-solving questions
1. What is great about this problem?
2. What is not perfect yet?
3. What am I willing to do to make it the way I want?
4. What am I willing to no longer do in order to make it the way I want it?
5. How can I enjoy the process while I do what is necessary to make it the way I want?

"he that cannot ask cannot live" - old proverb
