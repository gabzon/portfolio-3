I've always dreamed of having the ability to help people change virtually anything in their lives.

I thought I could teach me the foundamentatls of how to shift human behavior and emotion.

I wanted to get myself motivated, get myself to follow through and take action, learn how to enjoy life, and learn how to connect and bond with people, I'm not sure why, but somehow I linked pleasure to learning and sharing things that could make a difference in the quality of people's lives and lead them to appreciate and maybe even love me.

I read close to 700 books in just a few years, almoset all of them in the areas of human development, psychology, influence, and psychological development. I wanted to know anything and everything there was to know about how we can increase the quality of our lives, and tried to immediately apply it to myself as well as share it with other people.

All changes are created in a moment.

In reality, change is only difficult because most of us don't know ho to change! We don't have an effective strategy. Willpower by itself is not enough - not if we want to achieve a lasting change.

Culturally, we link negative associations to the ideas of instant change.

The commitments to grow, expand, contribute, and thereby make a difference. I realized as each smiling face came forward how deeply grateful I was to have developed skills that can make a difference in helping poeple to change virtually anything in their lives.

Once we affect a change, we should reinforce it immediately. Then, we have to condition our nervous systems to succeed not just once, but consistently.

We've got to condition ourselves for success, love, and for breaking our fears.

NAC = science of Neuro-Associative Conditioning
NAC is a step by step process that can condition your nervous system to associate pleasure to those things you want to continuously move toward and pain to those things you want to avoid in order to succeed consistently in your life without constant effort or willpower.

"things do not change; we change"- Henry David Thoreau

Isn't it true that we all want to change either 1) how we feel about things or 2) our behaviours?

The only way this can happen is by linking pain to the old behaviour and pleasure to the new behaviour

The first belief we must have if we're going to create a change quickly is that we can change now.

After all, if you can create a problem in a moment, you should be able to create a solution, too!

The second belief that you and I must have if we are going to create a long-term change is that we're responsible for our own change, not anyone else.

1) first, we must believe, "something must change"
2) Second, we must not only believe that things must change, but we must believe, "I must change it"
3) Third, we have to believe, "I can change it" (You have to be the source of your change)

Nothing changes until we change the sensations we link to an experience in our nervous system.

THE POWER OF YOUR BRAIN
By contrast, a reaction in one neuron can spread to hundreads of thousands of others in a span of less than 20 milliseconds. To give you perspective, that's about then times less than it talkes for your eye to blink.

Why can't we get ourselves to feel happy consistently? WE CAN!!

Neuro-science: your ticket to lasting change.

Each time we experience a significant amount of pain or pleasure, our brains search for the cause and record it in our nervous systems to enable us to make better decisions about what to do in the future.

"To the dull mind all nature is leaden. To the illumined mind the whole world burns and sparkles with light" - Ralph Waldo Emerson

This neuro-association is a biological reality - it's physical.

Courage, unused, diminishes. Commitment, unexercised, wanes. Love, unshared, dissipates.

"It is not enough to have a good mind; the main thing is to use it well"-Rene Descartes

Anytime you experience significant amount of pain or pleasure, your brain immediately searches for the cause. It uses the following 3 criteria:
1) Your brain looks for something that appears to be unique.
2) Your brain looks for something that seems to be happening simultaneously
3) Your brain looks for consistency

Because the 3 criteria for forming neuro-associations are so imprecise, it is very easy to fall prey to misinterpretations and create false neuro-associations.

So often we blame the wrong cause, and thereby close ourself off from possible solutions.

A SOURCE OF SELF-SABOTAGE
mixed neuro-associations
When you give your brain mixed messages, you are going to get mixed results

THE PAIN BARRIER
When you get to the point where you know you are going to have pain. What do you do? We become immobilised-- we don't know what to do.
