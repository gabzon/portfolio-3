12. The magnificent obsession - creating a compelling future

"nothing happens unless first dream" - Carl sandburg

You possess a lamp that is not limited to a mere three wishes!

Once you decide to awaken this giant, you'll be unstoppable in creating mental, emotional, physical, financial, and spiritual abundance beyond your wildest fantasies.

GIANT goals produce giant motivation

I'll still find the drive I need because my goals are so exciting to me. They get me up early, keep me up late, and inspire me to marshal my resources and use everything I can possibly find within the sphere of my influence to bring them to fruition.

Often people tell me, "my problems is that I reall y don't have any goals" This belief demonstrates their lack of understanding of how goals really work. The human mind is always pursuing something, if nothing more than the ability to reduce or eliminate pain, or avoid anything that lead to it. Our brain also love ot guide us in pursuing anything that can lead to the creation of pleasure. We all have goals. The problem, as I've stressed in virtually every chapter so far, is that we are unconscious in our use of these resources.

A lot of people are caught up in the trap of making a living rather than designing a life.

We all must discover or create a magnificent obsession

Goals take you behond your limits to a world of unlimited power

I usually know I've set the right goal is when it seems impossible but at the same time it's giving me a sense crazed excitement just to think about the possibility of achieving it. In order to truly find that inspiration and achieve those impossible goals, we must suspend our belief systems about what we're capable of achieving.

"we are what and where we are because we have first imagined it" - Donald curtis

Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into visible - The foundation for all success in life.

Turning the invisible into the visible

Look around yourself right now. What do you see? Are you sitting on a sofa, surrounded by fine art or watching a big-screen television employing the latest technology of laser disc? or are you seated at a desk that holds a telephone, computer, and fax machine? All of these objects were once just ideas in someone's mind. If I had told you 100 years ago that invisible waves from around the world could be pulled from the air and fed into a box to generate sounds and pictures, wouldn't you have considered me crazy?

In order that to happen, someone had to envision them with clarity.

Why doesn't everyone set goals?

All goals setting must be immediately followed by both the development of a plan, and massive and consistent action toward its fulfilment.

Surely you've been exposed to the power of goal setting before reading this book. But do you have a list of clearly defined goals for the results you will absolutely produce in your life mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, and financially? What has stopped you?

For many it's the unconscious fear of disappointment. Some people have set goals in the past and failed to achieve them and, as a result of their disappointment and their fear of future pain, they stop setting goals

The key to achieving goals

When you set a goal, you've committed to CANI! You've acknowledge the need that all human beings have for constant, never-ending improvement.

Remember that our stress level is self-induced, so let's induce it intelligently

Failing to achieve your goal can mean achieving your real goals

What do you think is the purpose of life?

"To be happy of course"

They wanted nothing from us except to share the bountiful happiness they felt for life.

It's not just getting a goal that matters, but the quality of life you experience along the way.

Live the dream

Many people go through life putting off their joy and happiness. To them, goal setting means that "someday" after tehy achieve something only then will they be able to enjoy life to the fullest. The truth is that if we decide to be happy now, we'll automatically achieve more.

The direction we're heading is more important than individual results.

Missing his dream had given him his future.

Sometimes we need to trust that our disappointments may truly be opportunities in disguise.

The key to achieving goals

Unleash the power of the Reticular Activating System (RAS) to achieve your goals

Your RAS is directly responsible for how much of reality you consciously experience

This shift in mental posture aligns you more precisely with your goals. Once you decide that something is a priority, you give it a tremendous emotional intensity, and by continually focusing on it, any resource that supports tis attainment will eventually become clear.

How to make your goals real

At least twice a day, you must rehearse and emotionally enjoy the experience of achieving each one of your most valued goals.

The purpose of the goal

We think that achieving our goal is the end, but if we had a greater understanding we'd realize that often in the pursuit of our goals, we set in motion processional effects that have consequences even more far reaching than we ever intended.

Goals are a mean to an end, not the ultimate purpose of our lives. They are simply a tool to concentrate our focus and move us in a direction. The only reason we really pursue goals is to cause ourselves to expand and grow. Achieving goals by themselves will never make us happy in the long term; it's who you become, as you overcome the obstacles necessary to achieve your goals, that can give you the deepest and most long-lasting sense of fulfilment.

So the key question you need to ask is " What kind of person will I have to become in order to achieve all that I want?" This is the most important question that you can ask yourself, for its answer will determine the direction you need to head personally.

TODO

Write a paragraph describing all the character traits, skills, abilities, attitudes, and beliefs that you would need to develop in order to achieve all of the goals you've written down previously

The kind of person I need to become in order to achieve all that I want: ____________________

The most important step

Make sure that as soon as you set goals you immediately begin to create momentum.

never leave the site of setting a goal without first taking some form of positive action toward its attainment

A true decision is one that you act upon, and one that you act upon now.

Take immediate action as soon as you finish this chapter

Then, Develop a list of simple things your can do every day for the next ten days. I can promise you that 10 days of small actions in the direction of your goals will begin to create a chain of habits that will ensure your long-term success.

Evaluate now what steps you must take

Remember, you need to experience the feeling of achieving your top one-year goals in each of the four categories at least once a day.

Achieving our goals can be a curse unless we have already set up a new set of higher goals before we reach the first

How do people achieve their heart's desire and still feel the excitement and passion that come from aiming toward a goal? As they approach what they've pursued for so long, they immediately establish a new set of compelling goals

Contribution may be the ultimate goal

A compilling future is the food on which our souls thrive.

Program yourself for success

Reinforce your new neural pathways by continuous rehearsals, with repetition and emotional intensity. Imagine your goals vividly again and again. Incorporate the visual, auditory, kinaesthetic elements that will make your goal a reality.

The ultimate lesson

"where there is no vision, people perish"- Proverb, 29:18
