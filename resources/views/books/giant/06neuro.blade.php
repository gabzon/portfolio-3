"The beginning of a habit is like an invisible thread, but every time we repeat the act we strengthen the strand, add to it another filament, until it becomes a great cable and binds us irrevocably thought and act" - Orison swett madden

If you and I want to change our behaviour, there is only one effective way to do it: we must link unbearable and immediate sensations of pain to our old behaviro, and incredible and immediate sensations of pleasure to a new one.

These 6 steps of NAC will show you how to create a direct highway our of pain and into pleasure with no disempowering detours. They are:

1. Decide what you really want and what's preventing you from having it now
2. Get Leverage: Associate Massive pain to not changing now and massive pleasure to the experience of changing now!
3.Interrupt the limiting pattern
4.Create a new empowering alternative
5.Condition the new pattern until is consistent
6. Test it!

1. Decide what you really want and what's preventing you from having it now
The first step to creating any change is deciding what you do want so that you have something to move forward.

2. Get Leverage: Associate Massive pain to not changing now and massive pleasure to the experience of changing now!
Change is usually not a question of capability, it's almost always a question of motivation.
Change is often a should and not a must. The only way we're going to make a change now is if we create a sense of urgency that's so intense that we're compelled to follow through.

On the other hand we fear change. Sometimes we have mixed emotions where we link pain and pleasure to changing. Which causes our brains to be uncertain of what to do, and keep us from our full potential.

How do we turn this around?
One way is by reaching pain threshold, you experience a pain at such an intense level that you know you must change now, you think that's enough. this usually comes from fear of the unknown.

20% of any change is knowing how; and 80% is knowing why

"give me a lever enough and a prop strong enough. I can single-handedly move the world" - Archimedes

The greatest leverage you can create fro yourself is the pain that comes from inside, not outside. Knowing that you have failed to live up to your own standards for your life is the ultimate pain.

One of the strongest forces in the human personality is the drive to preseve the integrity of our own identity.

Why would someone not change when they feel and know that they should? They associate more pain to making the change than to not changing.

To get true leverage, ask yourself pain-inducing questions:
- What will this cost me if I don't change?
- Ultimately what will I miss out on in my life if I don't make the shift?
- What is it already costing me mentally, emotionally, physically, financially, spiritually?
Make the pain of not changing feel so real to you, so intense, so immediate that you can't put off taking that action any longer.

The second step use pleasure-associating questions to help you link those positive sensations to the idea of changing.
if I do change, how will that make me feel about myself?
What kind of momentum could I create if I change this in my life?
What other things could I accomplish if I really make this change today?
How will my family and friends feel?
How much happier will I be now?

3. Interrupt the limiting pattern
The challenge is that most people want a new result, but continue to act in the same way. I once heard it said that the definition of insanity is "doing the same things over and over again and expecting a different result"

We can be highly motivated to change, but if we keep doing the same things, running the same inappropriate patterns, our lives are not going to change, and all we'll experience is more and more pain and frustration.

One of the best ways to interrupt someone's pattern is to do things they don't expect.
Next time you start to feel depressed, jump up look at the sky and yell in your most idiotic tone of voice. "HALLELUJAH! my feet don't stink today" This will change your state.
The more outrageous your approach to breaking a pattern, the more effective it will be.

<strong>How to break limiting patterns of feeling and acting</strong>
A simple way of breaking a pattern is by scrambling the sensations we link to our memories.
Example: your boss yells at you, and you spend the whole day thinking about it. instead, erase this memory and make a new one, a funny one.

<strong>The scramble patterns</strong>
1-See the situation in your mind that was bothering you so much. Picture it as a movie. Don't upset about it; just watch it one time, seeing everything that happened

2-Take that same experience and turn it into a cartoon. Sit up in your chair with a big, silly grin on your face. Play the image backwards, see everything in reverse. If someone say something watch them swallow their words. Run it forward again in faster motion. Change the colors of the image, everybody's faces are rainbow-colored. The person that upsets you put him/her big ears like Mickey Mouse, and the nose of Pinocchio.

Do this at least a dozen times, back and forth, sideways add speed and humour, music, anything you like until you change the images that upset you. This will definitely change the sensations. Key to this whole process is the speed at which you play back the imagery and the level of humor and exaggeration you can link to it.

3-Now think about the situation that was bothering you, and notice how you feel now.

Why does it work? Because all of our feelings are based on the images we focus on in our minds and the sounds and sensations we link to those specific images.

4. Create a new empowering alternative.
This 4th step is absolutely critical to establishing a long-term change. In fact, the failure by most people to find an alternative way of getting out of pain and into the feelings of pleasure is the major reason most people's attempt at change are only temporary.

Depression can be replaced with a focus on how to help others who are in need.

You can simply find the answers by modeling people who have turned things around for themselves.

<strong>Studies in transformation</strong>

The adoption of a replacement behavior appears to play a major role.
External pressure rarely has a lasting impact.
Replace behaviors or addiction with a new alternative.

5. Condition the new pattern until it's consistent
Emotional intensity
Remember your brain can't tell the difference between something you vividly imagine and something you actually experience.
Realize that you and I can condition any behavior within ourselves if we do it with enough repetition and emotional intensity.

The next step is to set up a schedule to reinforce your new behaviour. How can you reward yourself for succeeding? Don't wait until you've gone a year without smoking. Why you've gone a day, give yourself a reward. Don't wait until you've lost eighty pounds. Don't even wait until you've lost a pound. The minute you can push the plate away with food still on it, give yourself a pat on the back. Set up a series of short-term goals, or milestones and as you reach each one, immediately reward yourself. If you've been depressed or worried, now each time you take action instead of worrying or each time you smile when somebody asks how your're doing and you say "Great" give yourself a reward for already beginnng to make the changes necessary to ensure your long-term success.

Positive reinforcement training

"There is nothing training cannot do. Nothing is above its reach. It can turn bad morals to good; it can destroy bad principles and recreate good ones; it can lift men to angelship"Mark twain

The law of reinforcement
Any pattern of emotion or behavior that is continually reinforced will become an automatic and conditioned response. Anything we fail to reinforce will eventually dissipate.

Reinforcement is responding to a behaviour immediately after it occurs, while punishment and reward may occur long afterward.

<strong>Timing is everything</strong>
Appropriate timing is absolutely critical to effective conditioning. If a coach yells "great" when the basketball team executes a perfect pick-and-roll, it has a lot more impact than if he waited until they debriefed later in the locker room. Why because we always want to link the sensations of reinforcement in the pattern that is occurring.

"Good and evil, reward and punishment, are the only motives to a rational creature: These are the spur and reins whereby all mankind are set on work, and guided" John Locke

<strong>Schedule your reinforcement so change lasts</strong>
1 Variable schedule of reinforcement
If someone is always rewarded, they may become habituated and will no longer give 100%.
Reinforcement: rewards should not become a habit but a incentive. (just like dolphins)
uncertainty is a key element in t

2 Fixed schedule of reinforcement: Always giving a reward in a consitent way, problem: we lose interest

3 Jackpot: Compound the reinforcement, give many rewards without saying. This compels people to consistently give more of itself

<strong>Create a "Jump Start"</strong>
The most important thing to remember about conditioning, however, is to reinforce the desired behaviour immediately.

Conditioning is critical. This is how we produce consistent results. Once again, remember that any pattern of emotional behavior that is reinforced or rewarded on a consistent basis will become conditioned and automatic. Any pattern that we fail to reinforce will eventually dissipate.

6. Test it!
Review 1: If it doesnt work, Are you clear about what you want and why you want it?
Review 2: get more leverage on yourself, make your commitment public!
review 3: If you don't have enough leverage check step 3. You haven't change your approach, you must interrupt your pattern (Stop hitting yourself against the window like a fly)
Review 4: IF everything is ok go to step 4. If you haven't produced a change is because you need to find a new, empowering alternative for getting yourself out of pain and into pleasure that is as powerful and convenient as your old approach was.
Review 5: Utilize both variable and fixed schedules of reinforcement to make sure that your new, empowering pattern lasts.

----------
The ecology check
1. Make certain pain is fully associated with the old pattern
When you thing of your old behavior or feeling, do you picture and feel things that are painful now instead of pleasurables?

This 6 steps of NAC can be used for anything: relationships, business, socially, at home, etc.
How can I use the six steps to change this disempowering pattern?
1) Ask yourself: "What do I want to do instead of worry?"
2) Get leverage on yourself and realize what worry does to destroy your life; see what it would cost you ultimately in your life so that you're not willing to pay that price anymore.
3) Interrupt the pattern. Every time you worry, break the pattern by doing and being totally outrageous.
4) Create an empowering alternative. What will you do instead of worry? Write down a plan of what you can immediately do instead?
5) Condition your new pattern: vividly imagine and rehearse this new pattern with tremendous emotinal intensity and repetition until this new thought, behavior or emotional pattern is automatic.

You can even use these same 6 steps of NAC to negotiate a contract
1. The first step is to lay the groundwork. Get clear about what you want and what has prevented you from getting it. What does the other person want? what's in it for both of you? how will you know you have a successful contract?
2. Get leverage by getting that person that person to link pain to not making the deal, and pleasure to make it
3. Interrupt the pattern of any belief or idea that's keeping the deal from moving ahead
4. Create an alternative that neither of you thought of before that will meet both your needs.
5. Reinforce that alternative by constantly reinforcing the pleasure and the positive impact of this alternative
6. See if it's going to work out for everybody, a win-win situation. If so, negotiate to a successful conclusion.
