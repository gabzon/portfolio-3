"Under all that we think, lives all we believe, like the ultimate veil of our spirit" - Antonio machado

It's not the events of our lives that shape us, but our beliefs as to what those events mean.

Meaning vs Beliefs vs generalisations vs sense of certainty

It's never the environment, its never the events of our lives but the meaning we attached to the events - how we interpret them - that shapes who we are today and who we'll become tomorrow.

Most of our beliefs are generalizations about our past, based on our interpretations of painful and pleasureble experiences.

The challenge is tree fold:
1. most of us do not consciously decide waht we're going to believe.
2. often our beliefs are based on misinterpretation of past experiences
3. once we adopt a belief, we forget its merely an interpretation, We begin to treat our beliefs as if they're realities, as if they are gospel.

All of our actions are the result of our beliefs. Whatever we do, it out of our conscious or unconscious beliefs abut what will lead to pleasure or away from pain. If you want to create long-term, and consistent changes in your behaviours, you must change the beliefs that are holding you back.

Beliefs have the power to create and the power to destroy!

If we don't adopt the faith that there is a reason for the unexplainable tragedies of life, then we begin to destroy our capacity to truly live.

"Drugs are not always necessary, [but] belief in recovery always is" - Norman cousins

Our beliefs affect our physical bodies

Once accepted, our beliefs become unquestioned commands to our nervous systems, and they have the power to expand or destroy the possibilities of our present and future.

Feeling of certainty.

With enough emotional intensity and repetition, our nervous systems experience something as real, even if it hasn't occurred yet.

"the belief that becomes truth for me... is that which allows me the best use of my strength, the best means of putting my virtues into action"- Andr√© gide

Great leaders are rarely "realistic".

Yet this unrealistic evaluation of their own performance is the secret of their future success.

But an optimist operates with beliefs such as "the past doesn't equal the future"

If you develop the absolute sense of certainty that powerful belifs provide, then you can get yourself to accomplish virtually anything, including those things that other people are certain are impossible.

"Only in men's imagination does every truth find an effective and undeniable existence. Imagination, not invention, is the supreme master of art, as of life" - Joseph conrad.

One of the biggest challenges in anyone's lives is knowing how to interpret "failures". How we deal with life's "defeats" and what we determine is the cause will shape our destinies. We need to remember that how we deal with adversity and challenges will shape our lives more than almost anything else.

Many of our country's greatest achieviers have succeeded in spite of running into huge problems and barriers.

The solution to both permanence and pervasivesess is to see something you can take control of in your life, and befing to talke action in that direction. AS you do this, some of these limiting beliefs will disappear

"It is the mind that maketh good of ill, that maketh wretch or happy, rich or poor" - Edmund spenser.

How to change a belief
All personal breakthroughs begin with a change of beliefs. The most effective way is to get yoru brain to associate massive pain to the old belief. You must feel deep in your gut that this belief has cost you in the past, and in the present.

Everything we do, we do either out of the need to avoid pain or our desire to gain pleasure and if we associate enough pain to anything, we'll change.

New experiences trigger change only if they cause us to question our beliefs. Remember, whenever we believe something, we no longer question it in any way.

If you question anything enough, eventually you'll begin to doubt!

Our belief have different levels of emotional certainty and intensity, and it's important to know just how intense they erally are. In fact, in've classified beliefs into three categories. Opinions, beliefs and convictions.

Opion: is something we feel relatively certain about.
Belifs: is someting we feel more certain than opinions, it is formed when we begin to develop a much larger base of references legs. especially references legs about which we have strong emotions.
Conviction: eclipses a belief, you are sure! you feel it. Primarily because of the emotioanl intensity a person to an idea.

How can we create a conviction?
1) Start with the basic belif
2) Reinforce your belief by adding new ad more powerful references
3) Then find a triggering event, or else create one of your own. Associate yourself fully by asking "what will it cost me if I don't?" Ask questions that create emotional intensity for you.
4) Take action

Using social proof is a great way to limit your life--to make it just like everybody else's. Some of the strongest social proof that people use is information that they get from "experts".

Trusting experts blindly is not well-advised. Don't blindly what people tell you. Consider things in the context of your own life; does it make sense for you?

Pain is the ultimate tool for shifting a belief.
The way to expand our lives is to model the lives of those people who are already succeding.
"What are what we think, All that we arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts we make our world" - The buddha.

The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauser stated, all truth goes throught three steps:
First, it is ridiculed
Second, it is violently opposed
Finally, it is accepte as a self-evidence.

In business we have a set of false beliefs that are leading us down a road of economic frustration.

Quality is not just a matter of meeting a certain standard, but rather was a living, breathing process of never-ending improvement.

Quality always costs less. This was directly the opposite of what most people believed.

One toxic belif that may be destroying our economic strength as a nation is what deming calls "managing the invisible numbers". the conventional corporate belief that profits are made by cutting costs and increasing of revenues.

Keizen = constant improvement

My commitment to constantly improve, to constantly raise my own standards for a quality life is what's kept me both happy and successful. I realized that we all need a word to anchor ourselves to focus of constant and never-ending improvement.

Constant commitment backed up by action

The only true security in life comes from knowing that every single day you are improving yourself in some way. Knowing that you are valuable to your business, friends and family.

I don't worry about maintaining the quality of my life, because every day I work on improving it.

Small improvement are believable and therefore achievable

Rememeber, the key to success is developing a sense of certainty

Realize that your beliefs may change as you gather additional references. What really matters now is whether the belifs you have today empower or disempower you. Begin today to develop the habig of focusing on the consequences of all your beliefs are they strengthening your foundation by moving you to action in the direction you desire,  or are they holding you back?

"As he thinketh in his heart, so is he" - Proverbs 23:7

There is always a way to turn things around if I'm committed.
I turned my biggest challenges into my biggest opportunities

TODO
1 Begin to brainstorm all the beliefs you have both those that empower you and disempower you: little beliefs that don't seem to matter at all and global beliefs that seem to make a big difference. Make sure you cover:

a) If-then beliefs like "If I consistenly give my all, then I will succeed" or "If I'm totally passionate with this person, then they'll leave me"

b) Global beliefs, like "People are basically good" or "People are a pain" -
2.- Circle the three most empowering beliefs on your list, ask yourself:
<ul>
	<li>How do they empower you?</li>
	<li>How do they strengthen your life</li>
</ul>

3.- Circle the 3 most diempowering beliefs
Decide right now, once and for all that you're no longer willing to pay the price that these beliefs are charging your life. Ask yourself some of the following questions:
<ul>
	<li>How is this belief ridiculous or absurd?</li>
	<li>Was the person I learned this belief from worth modelling in this area?</li>
	<li>What will it ultimately cost me emotionally if I don't let go of this belief?</li>
	<li>What will it ultimately cost me in my relationship if I don't let go of this belif?</li>
	<li>What will it ultimately cost me physically if I don't let go of this belief?</li>
	<li>What will it ultimately cost me financially if I don't let go of this belief?</li>
	<li>What will it ultimately cost my familty / loved onces if I don't let go of this belief?</li>
</ul>

4. Write down the replacements for the two limiting beliefs you've just eliminated. What is the antithesis?
Ex: Instead of "I can never succeed because I'm a woman" you should say "Because I'm a woman, I have the resources available to me that no man could ever dream of"

If you're not getting the results you want in your life, I suggest you ask yourself. "What would I have to believe in order to succeed here in life?" or "Who is already succeeding in this area, and what do they believe differently than I do about what's possible?" or "What's necessary to believe in order to succeed?"

If you are depressed and you ask yourself "What would I have to believe in order to feel depressed?"You'll probably come up with a loooot of ideas. but the more question you ask to yourself you'll see that you don't believe most of it. You know you are capable of!

Nothing in live has any meaning except the meaning that you give it. so make sure you "consciously" choose the meanings that are most in alignment with the destiny you've chosen for yourself.

I believe you picked up this book because deep down you've decided you will not settle for less than the best you know you're capable of.

LEADERSHIP AND THE POWER OF BELIEF
Leaders are those individuals who live by empowering beliefs and teach others to tap their full capabilities by shifting the beliefs that have been limiting them.
