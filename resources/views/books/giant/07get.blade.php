How to get what you really want

"all emotions are pure which gather you and lift you up; that emotion is impure which seize only one side of your being and so distorts you" - Rainer Maria Rilke

Happines comes from within (not outside)

What do you want?

Once you clearly know what you want. it could be have a loving family, be rich, be superstar, travel around the world,

you should ask yourself. Why do you want that?
What is the feeling behind? if you want a fast car, is it because of the speed or more because of the prestige?

I want the feeling of contribution and making a difference

When someone kisses you, what makes you feel good in that moment? is it the wet tissue touching wet tissue that really triggers the feeling? Of course not!!!! if that's true, kissing your dog would turn you on! All of our emotions are nothing but a flurry of biochemical storms in our brains - and we can spark them at any moment. But first we must learn how to take control of them consciously instead of living in reaction.

Most of our emotional responses are learned responses to the environment. We've deliberately modelled some of them, and stumbled across others.

the power of state

The difference between acting badly or brilliantly is not based on your ability, but on the state of your mind and/or body in any given moment.

Your behaviour is not the result of your ability, but of the state that you're in at this moment.

You've got to focus on what empowers you.

There are two primary ways to change your emotional state:
1. Change your physical body
2. Change your focus

1. Physiology: The power of movement

Emotion is created by motion

Your body leads your emotions

"We know too much and feel too little. At least we feel too little of those creative emotions from which a good life springs" - Bertrand Russell

Anyone can continue to feel good if they already feel good, or if they're "on a roll"; it doesn't take much to accomplish this. But the real key in life is to be able to make yourself feel good when you don't feel good or when you don't even want to feel good. know that you can do this instantaneously by using your body as a tool to change state.

You and I have the capacity to make changes like this at any time.

The key to success is to create patterns of movements that create confidence, a sense of strength, flexibility, a sense of personal power, and fun.

Why not make cheerfulness, outrageousness, playfulness a new priority for yourself? Make feeling good your expectation. You don't have to have a reason to feel good-you are alive; you can feel good for no reason at all!

2. Focus the power of concentration

Whatever we focus on becomes our idea of reality

focus is not true reality, because it's one view. it's only one perception of the way things really are.

Think of that view-the power of focus- as being a camera lens. It only shows the picture and the angle of what is focused on. Because of that photos can easily distort reality, presenting a small portion of the big picture.

Whatever we focus on will determine how we feel

Focus on where you want to go, not on what you fear

Focusing on the solution is always to your benefit.

Realize that you have to discipline your mind. A mind out of control will play tricks on you. A mind directed, it's your greatest friend.

"Ask and you will receive. Seek and you will find; knock and it will be open to you"-Matthew 7:7

"As the fletcher whittles and makes straight his arrows, so the master directs his straying thoughts" - The buddha

It's not only what you focus on but howâ€¦
Our experience of the world is created by gathering information through the use of our 5 senses. However, each person develop a favourite mode of focus, or modality.

There is 3 types of people according to their modalities.
1- Visual
2- Auditive
3- Kinesthetic (feeling)

You need to understand submodalities

TODO: Read a book from Richard Bandler

Understanding them enables you to not only change how you feel about any experience in your life, but to change what it means to you and thus what you can do about it.

Our ability to change the way we feel depends upon our ability to change our sub modalities

Common expressions based on:
**Visual submodalities**
- That really brightens my day
- That puts things in a better perspective
- that's a top priority
- This guy has a checkered past
- Let's look at the big picture
- This problem keeps staring me in the face

**Auditory submodalities**
- He's constantly giving me static about that
- The problem is screaming at me
- I hear you loud and clear
- I brought everything we were doing to a screeching halt
- the guy is really offbeat
- that sounds great

**Kinesthetic submodalities**
- That guy is slimy
- The pressure's off/the pressure's on
- This thing is weighing on me
- I feel like I'm carrying this whole thing on my back
- This concert is really hot
- I'm absolutely immersed in this project

*Create your own blueprint*

TODO (with someone else if possible):
Think of a time in your life when you had a very enjoyable experience, and do the following:
1 Rate your enjoyment from 0-100.
2 Go to the checklist of possible submodalities
3 Discover which elements are apt to create more enjoyment in your life than others, more pleasure feelings than pain feelings
4 Begin to evaluate each of the questions (see if it intensify or reduces the feeling from 0-100)

In fact, brightness is an important sub modality for most people brightening things intensifies their emotion.

Change your state and you change your life
You've got to be in a determined state in order to succeed

"Experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with what happens to him"-Aldous Huxley

You've got to realise that you must take conscious control of running you own mind.

The first skill you must master is to be able to change your state instantly no matter what the environment, no matter how scared or frustrated you are.

Live your life in a way that causes you to feel tons of pleasure and very little pain

All that you really want in life is to change how you feel. Again, all your emotions are nothing but biochemical storms in your brain, and you are in control of them at any moment in time.

"Any great and commanding moment in the annals of the world is the triumph of some enthusiasm" - Ralph Waldo Emerson

Do you know how to make yourself feel good?

TODO: Sit down write now and write down a list of things that you currently do to change how you feel.

1 Go for a walk and look far at the horizon
2 Swim
3 Dance salsa
4 Listen to music
5 Watch a funny movie
6 Listen to a motivational or inspiring disc, mp3, video, etc
7 Smile
8 Repeat many times I feel great
9 Gary grain and callahan techniques
10 Think on the future
11 Ask myself good questions and change my focus
12 Make love
13 Read a book
14 Dream building
15 Talk to a friend

If you don't have a plan for pleasure, you will have pain
Develop a plan for pleasure for each and every day. Don't just randomly hope that pleasure will somehow show up; set yourself up for ecstasy. Make room for it!

Remember: if you continue to have a limiting emotional pattern, it's because you are using your body in a habitual way, or are continuing to focus in a certain disempowering way.
