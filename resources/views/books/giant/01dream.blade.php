  <h1>1. Dreams of Destiny</h1>

  "Deep within man dwell those slumbering powers; powers that would astonish him, that he never dreamed of possessing; forces that would revolutionise his life if aroused and put into action"

  <p>
    We all want to believe deep down in our souls that we have a special gift, that we can make a difference, that we can touch others in a special way, and that we can make the world a better place.

    I made a decision in that monument which was to alter my life forever. I decided to change vitally every aspect of my life. I decided I would never again settle for less that I could be.

    I believe most people fail in life simply because they major in minor things.

    Learning to understand what makes us do what we do. What shapes human behaviour? The answer to this questions provide critical keys to shaping your own destiny
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What makes the difference in the quality of people's lives?</li>
    <li>What is the secret that creates passionate, happy and grateful lives in many, while for others the refrain might be, "is that all there is?"</li>
    <li>How can I make immediate control of my life?</li>
    <li>What can I do today that can make a difference - that could help  me and others to shape our destinies?</li>
    <li>How can I expand learn, grow and share that knowledge with others in a meaningful and enjoyable way?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I decided that somehow I must contribute in some way that would live on long after I was gone</p>

  <h2>HOW TO CREATE LASTING CHANGE</h2>
  <p>For changes to be of any true value, they've got to be lasting and consistent.</p>

  <h3>3 principals</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span4">
      <hr>
      <h4>1. Raise your standards</h4>
      <p>I wrote down all the things I would no longer accept in my life, all the things I would no longer tolerate, and all the things that I aspired to becoming</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <hr>
      <h4>2. Change your limiting beliefs</h4>
      <p>
        Our beliefs are like unquestioned commands, telling us how things are, what's possible and what's impossible, what can and can not do. They shape every action, every thought and every feeling that we experience. As a result changing our belief systems is central to making any real and lasting change in our lives

        We must develop a sense of certainty that we can and will meet the new standards before we actually do.

      <h4>3. Change your strategy</h4>

  <h1>2 .Decisions the pathway to power</h1>
  [pl_blockquote pull="right" cite="Boris Pasternak"]
  "Man is born to live and not to prepare to live"
  [/pl_blockquote]

  <ul>
    <li>How am I going to live the next ten years of my life?</li>
    <li>How am I going to live today in order to create the tomorrow I'm committed to?</li>
    <li>What am I going to stand for from now on?</li>
    <li>what is important to me right now, and what will be important to me in the long term? What actions can I take today that will shape my ultimate destiny?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Different actions produce different results.

    What precedes all of our actions? What determines what actions we take, and therefore, who we become, and what our ultimate destination is in life? what is the father of action? The power of decisions
  </p>

  [pl_blockquote pull="right" cite="Tony Robbins"]
  "it's in the moments of decision that your destiny is shaped"
  [/pl_blockquote]

  [pl_blockquote pull="right" cite="Benjamin Disraeli"]
  "Man is not a creature of circumstances; circumstances are the creatures of men"
  [/pl_blockquote]

  <p>
    I decided who and what I was committed to having and being in my life.

    If you don't set a baseless standard for what you'll accept in your life, you'll find it's easy to slip into behaviours and attitudes or a quality of life that's far below what you deserve.

    You need to set a live by these standards no matter what happens in your life. Even if it all goes wrong , even if it rains on your parade, even if the stock market crashes, even if your lover leaves you, even if no one gives you the support that you need, you still must stay committed to your decision that you will live your life at the highest level.

    You and I have to remember one thing: there is virtually nothing that we have to do in this country. (obligation) Today! Right now you can make a decision.

    If you truly decide to, you can do almost anything.

    Awaken the giant power of decision and claim the birthright of unlimited power, radiant vitality

    Make a decision right now!!

    "Nothing can resist the human will that will stake even its existence on its stated purpose" - Benjamin disraeli

    Your life changes the moment you make a new, congruent, and committed decision.

    The most exciting thing about this force, this power, is that you already possess it.

    "This is who I am. This is what my life is about. And this is what I'm going to do. Nothing will stop me from achieving my destiny. I will not be denied" - Tony Robbins

  <h2>The ultimate success formula</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span">1-Decide what you want</div>
    <div class="span">2-Take action</div>

    Most people instead of making decisions keep stating preferences like "I'd like to quit smoking, I'd like to lose weight, etc"

    Making a true decision means committing to achieving a result. and then cutting yourself off from any other possibility

    We all know how great it feels to have a clear, unquestioned objectiveâ€¦ This kind of clarity gives you power.

    With clarity, you can produce the results that you really want for your life.

    The way to make better decisions is to make more of them

    Information is power when it's acted upon

    Repetition is the mother of skill
  </p>

  <h2>3 decisions that control your destiny are:</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span4">1. What to focus on</div>
    <div class="span4">2. What things mean to you</div>
    <div class="span4">3. What to do to create the results you desire</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    It's your decisions about what to focus on, what things mean to you, and what you're going to do about them that will determine your ultimate destiny
  </p>

  [pl_blockquote cite="Henry David Thoreau"]
  "I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor"
  [/pl_blockquote]

  <p>
    The Niagara syndrome: life is like a river, and most people jump on the river of life without ever really deciding where they want to end up

    This people become a part of the mass of people who are directed by the environment instead of by their own values. As a result, they feel out of control.

    It's likely that whatever challenges you have in your life currently could have been avoided by some better decision upstream

        The scary thing is that most people never consciously set this system up.Instead its been installed throughout the years by sources as divers as parents, peers, teachers, television, advertisers, and the culture at large. This system is comprised of five components:

  [/pl_blockquote]

  <p>
    We must *overcome* our fears of making the wrong decisions. Without a doubt, you will make wrong decisions in your life. You are going to screw up!!!

    Instead be determined that no matter what decision I make, i'll be flexible, look at the consequences, learn from them, and use those lessons to make better decisions in the future.

    <span class="label label-info">Remember:</span> Success truly is the result of good judgement. Good judgement is the result of experience, and experience is often the result of bad judgement!

    Find a role model:
    You can have a role model for your finance, a model for your relationships, a model for your health, a model fro your profession, or a model for any aspect of your life you're learning to master. They can save you years of pain and keep you from going over the falls.

    Successful person: the reason they're more successful is that they've made more poor decisions than you have.

    Don't beat yourself for being a failure, remember that there are not failures in life. There are only results. If you didn't get the results you wanted, learn from this experience so that you have references about how to make better decisions in the future.

  [pl_blockquote pull="right" cite="Hannibal"]
  "We will either find a way or make one"
  [/pl_blockquote]

  One of the most important decisions you can make to ensure your long-term happiness is to decide to use whatever life gives you in the moment. You need to:
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span3">1. Crealy decide what it is that you're absolutely committed to achieving</div>
    <div class="span3">2. You are willing to take massive action</div>
    <div class="span3">3. You notice what's working or not</div>
    <div class="span3">4. You continue to change your approach until you achieve what you want, using whatever life gives you along the way</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    In order to succeed you must have a long-term focus.

    It's all the small decisions along the way that cause people to fail.

    Success is the result of making small decisions: deciding to hold yourself to a higher standard, deciding to contribute, deciding to feed your mind rather than allowing the environment to control you.

    Deciding to commit yourself to long-term results, rather than short-term fixes, is as important as any decision you'll make in your lifetime. Failing to do this can cause not only massive financial or societal pain. but sometimes even the ultimate personal pain.

        Studies have shown that the most successful people make decisions rapidly because they are clear on their values and what they really want for their lives

        You know you've truly made a decision when action flows from it

        Ask yourself: what's good about this? what can I learn from this? This failure amy be an unbelievable gift in disguise if you use it to make better decisions in the future. Rather than focus on the short-term setback

  <h1>Know that it is your decisions and not your conditions that determine your destiny</h1>

  <div class="well">
    <em></em>
    <p>
      Prove to yourself that you've decided now. Make one or two decisions that you've been putting off: one easy decision and one that's a bit more difficult. Show yourself what you can do. Right now, stop. Make at least one clear cut decision that you've been putting off- take the first action toward fulfilling it.- and stick to it! By doing this, you'll be building that muscle that will give you the will to change your entire life.
