"Men live by intervals of reason under the sovereignty of humor and passion" -sir thomas browne

Everything you and I do, we do either out of our need to avoid pain or our desire to gain pleasure

You know you need to take action, but you don't to it. There is one elementary reason: We keep trying to changer our behaviour, which is the effect, instead of dealing with the cause behind it.

Why don't you do things you know you should do?

"A man who suffers before it is necessary, suffers more than necessary" - Seneca

For most people, the fear of loss is much greater than the desire for gain.

The fact is that most people would work much harder to hang on to what they have than they would to take the risks necessary to get what they really want from their lives.

"The secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having plain and pleasure use you. If you do that, you're in control of your life, if you don't, life controls you"-Anthony Robbins

emotional threshold = you hit a level of pain you weren't willing to settle for anymore.

I've had it - never again - this stops now!! this is the magical moment when pain becomes our friend.

The pain of doing something frivolous and inappropriate is greater than the pleasure the music could bring. Each day our lives are filled with these kind of psychic negotiations. We are constantly weighing our own proposed actions and the impact they will have upon us.

When I began to see that what I could share helps people increase the quality of their lives, I discovered the ultimate level of pleasure! And my life's purpose began to evolve.

if we link massive pain to any behaviour or emotional pattern, we will avoid indulging in it at all costs. We can use this understanding to harness the force of pain and pleasure to change virtually anything in our lives.

"if you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but to your own estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment"- Marcus Aurelius

One of the things that makes us so special is our marvelous ability to adapt, to transform, to manipulate objects or ideas to produce something more pleasing or useful.

But if we fail to direct our own associations to pain and pleasure, we are living no better than animals and machines.

What you link pain and pleasure to will shape your destiny

"Men, as well as women, are much oftener led by their hearts than by their understanding" - Lord Chesterfield

We must link pain to our old behaviour and pleasure to our new behaviour, and condition it until it's consistent. Remember, we will all do more to avoid pain than we will to gain pleasure.

The truth is that we can learn to condition our minds, bodies and emotions to link pain or pleasure to whatever we choose. By changing what we link pain and pleasure to, we will instantly change our behaviour.

If you don't have a plan for your live, someone else does

Any time we are in an intense emotional state, when we are feeling strong sensations of pain or pleasure, anything unique that occurs consistently will become neurologically linked.

people do more to avoid pain than to gain pleasure

if we don't direct our own thoughts. we'll fall under the influence of those who would condition us to behave in the way they desire.

We must learn to "advertise" in our minds- and we can do this in a moment. How? Simply by linking pain to the behaviours we want to stop at such a high level of emotional intensity that we won't even consider those behaviors any longer. Then link pleasure to the new behaviour you desire for yourself.

So what's the first step to creating a change? the first step is simply becoming aware of the power that pain and pleasure exert over every decision, and every action we take.

The are of being aware is understanding that these linkages - linkages- between ideas, words, images, sounds and sensations of pain and pleasure - are happening constantly

"I conceive that pleasure are to be avoided if greater pain be the consequence, and pains to be coveted that will terminate in greater pleasures" - Michel de montaigne.

The problem is that most of us base our decisions about what to do on what's going to create pain or pleasure in the short term instead of the long term.Yet, in order to succeed, most of the things that we value require us to be able to break through the wall of short-term pain in order to have long-term pleasure.

Focus on what's most important in the long term: your values and personal standards.
It's not actual pain that drives us, but our fear that something will lead to pain. And it's not actual pleasure that drives us, but our belief-our sense of certainty-that somehow taking a certain action will lead to pleasure.

Breaking through short-tearm pain. Once you've done it enought times, working out becomes pleasurable.

Trying to eliminate pain by solving a problem while nurturing the cause.

"Nature has placed mankind under the government of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure... they govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think: every effort we can make to throw off our subjection, will serve but to demonstrate and confirm it" - Jeremy benthan

"A bird in the had is worth two in the bush" These beliefs keep us from taking the actions that could change our lives.

We are allowing that fear to control us. we must make sure that we live our lives in the present and resond to things that are real, not to our fears of what once was or what might someday be. The key thing to remember to is that we don't move away from real pain; we move away from what we believe will lead to pain.

Let's make some changes right now:
First, write down four actions that you need to take that you've been putting off.

Second, under each of these actions, write down the answer to the followin questions: Why haven't I taken action? In the past, what pain have I linked to talking this action?

Third, write down all the pleasure you^ve had in the past by indulging in this negative pattern.

Fourth, write down what it will cost you if you don't change now, How does that (and will) make you feel?

Final step, write down all the pleasure you'll receive by taking each of these action right now

"Habit is either the best of servants or worst of masters" - Nathaniel Emmons

The mark of champion is consistency!

I am dedicated to producing a measurable increase in the quality of our lives.

In order to take our lives to the next level, however, we must realize that the same pattern of thinking that has gotten us to where we are will not get us to where we want to go.

A new level of thinking is now required in order to experience a new level of personal and professional success

To do this, we must once and for all break through the barriers of our fear and take control of the focus of our minds.

We have to be able to notice when we start to have a negative pattern-not beat ourselves up about it, and not dwell on it-but simply break the patterns as quickly as we discover them.

TODO

For the next ten days, beginning immediately, commit to taking full control of all your mental and emotional faculties by deciding right now that you will not indulge in or dwell on any unresourceful thoughts or emotions for ten consecutive days.

You could change your worried state immediately by focusing on a solution. You could ask yourself a better question like, " What do I need to do right now to make this better?" Or you could change your state by changing your vocabulary you use to describe the sensations you're feeling: from "worried" to a "a little bit concerned".

Ask yourself empowering questions like:
- What could I learn from this?
- What's great about this situation, and what's yet not perfect?

What other ways do you have to change your state?

Remember our goal is not to ignore the problems of life, but to put ourselves in better mental and emotional states where we can not only come up with solutions, but act upon them.

Always be in a resourceful state

In life, never spend more than 10 percent of your time on the problem. and spend at least 90% of your time on the solution. Most important, don't sweat the small stuff... and remember, it's small stuff!

During this 10 days program, you will spend 100% of your time in the solutions, and not the problems.

Won't this make my problems worse?
Ten days of focusing entirely upon solutions, on what works, and how lucky you are will not make your problem worse. But these new pattern may make you so strong that what you once thought was a problem may disappear as you assume a new identity of an unstoppable and joyous human being

The 10-day mental challenge - rules of the game

Rule 1. In the next ten consecutive days, refuse to dwell on any unresourceful thoughts or feelings. Refuse to indulge in any disempowering questions or devitalizing vocabulary or metaphors.

Rule 2. When you catch yourself beginning to focus on the negative-and you certantly will- you are to immediately use the techniques you've learned to redirect your focus toward a better emotional state. Specifically, use the problem-solving question as your first line in track.

In addition, set yourself up for success each morning for the next ten days by asking yourself the morning power questions. You can do them before you get out of bed or in the shower, but make sure to do them right away. this will focus you in the direction of establishing empowering metntal and emotinal patterns each day as you awake. Do the evening power questions too, right before sleep.

Rule 3. For the next ten consecutive days, make certain that your whole focus in life is on solutions and not on problems. The minute you see a possible challenge,  immediately focus on what the solution could be.

Rule 4. If you backslide-that is, if you catch yourself indulging in our dwelling on a unresourceful thought or feeling- don't beat yourself up. There's no problem with this as long as you change immediately. However, if you continue to dwell on unresourcefull thoughts or feelings for any measureble length of time, you must wait until the following morning and start the ten days over. The goal of this program is ten consecutive days without holdng or dwellling on a negative thought.

I immediately focus on how I can convert the challenge into an opportunity.

"We first make our habits, and then our habits make us." - John dryden

You'll be sending your brain a new message and commanding new results. You will be demanding empowering emotions, enriching thoughts, inspiring questions.

A word of caution: Don't begin this ten-day commitment unless and until you are certain that you are going to live by it for the full length of time.

Obstacles
Lazyness:
What stands in the way of just deciding to banish them? Three things really. One is laziness. A lot of people know what they should do, but never quite get up the energy to do it.

Fear:
All too often, the security of a mediocre present is more comfortable than the adventure of trying to be more in the future.

Force of habit:
We all have emotional patterns. the deadening force of routine.

This exercise is a ways to get beyond all three and produce lasting changes with benefits that can multiply over time.

Believe me, the power inherent in this little exercise is amazing. If you stick with it, it will do four things for you. First, it will make you acutely aware of all the habitual mental patterns that hold you back. Second, it will make your brain search for empowering alternatives to them. Third, it will give you an incredible jolt of confidence as you see that you can turn your life around. Fourth, and most importantly, it will create new habits, new standards, and new expectations that will help you expand more than you could ever believe.
