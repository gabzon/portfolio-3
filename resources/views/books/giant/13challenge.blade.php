The ten-day mental challenge!

"Habit is either the best of servants or worst of masters" - Nathaniel Emmons

The mark of champion is consistency!

I am dedicated to producing a measurable increase in the quality of our lives.

In order to take our lives to the next level, however, we must realize that the same pattern of thinking that has gotten us to where we are will not get us to where we want to go.

A new level of thinking is now required in order to experience a new level of personal and professional success

To do this, we must once and for all break through the barriers of our fear and take control of the focus of our minds.

We have to be able to notice when we start to have a negative pattern-not beat ourselves up about it, and not dwell on it-but simply break the patterns as quickly as we discover them.

TODO

For the next ten days, beginning immediately, commit to taking full control of all your mental and emotional faculties by deciding right now that you will not indulge in or dwell on any unresourceful thoughts or emotions for ten consecutive days.

You could change your worried state immediately by focusing on a solution. You could ask yourself a better question like, " What do I need to do right now to make this better?" Or you could change your state by changing your vocabulary you use to describe the sensations you're feeling: from "worried" to a "a little bit concerned".

Ask yourself empowering questions like:
- What could I learn from this?
- What's great about this situation, and what's yet not perfect?

What other ways do you have to change your state?

Remember our goal is not to ignore the problems of life, but to put ourselves in better mental and emotional states where we can not only come up with solutions, but act upon them.

Always be in a resourceful state

In life, never spend more than 10 percent of your time on the problem. and spend at least 90% of your time on the solution. Most important, don't sweat the small stuff... and remember, it's small stuff!

During this 10 days program, you will spend 100% of your time in the solutions, and not the problems.

Won't this make my problems worse?
Ten days of focusing entirely upon solutions, on what works, and how lucky you are will not make your problem worse. But these new pattern may make you so strong that what you once thought was a problem may disappear as you assume a new identity of an unstoppable and joyous human being

The 10-day mental challenge - rules of the game

Rule 1. In the next ten consecutive days, refuse to dwell on any unresourceful thoughts or feelings. Refuse to indulge in any disempowering questions or devitalizing vocabulary or metaphors.

Rule 2. When you catch yourself beginning to focus on the negative-and you certantly will- you are to immediately use the techniques you've learned to redirect your focus toward a better emotional state. Specifically, use the problem-solving question as your first line in track.

In addition, set yourself up for success each morning for the next ten days by asking yourself the morning power questions. You can do them before you get out of bed or in the shower, but make sure to do them right away. this will focus you in the direction of establishing empowering metntal and emotinal patterns each day as you awake. Do the evening power questions too, right before sleep.

Rule 3. For the next ten consecutive days, make certain that your whole focus in life is on solutions and not on problems. The minute you see a possible challenge, Â immediately focus on what the solution could be.

Rule 4. If you backslide-that is, if you catch yourself indulging in our dwelling on a unresourceful thought or feeling- don't beat yourself up. There's no problem with this as long as you change immediately. However, if you continue to dwell on unresourcefull thoughts or feelings for any measureble length of time, you must wait until the following morning and start the ten days over. The goal of this program is ten consecutive days without holdng or dwellling on a negative thought.

I immediately focus on how I can convert the challenge into an opportunity.

"We first make our habits, and then our habits make us." - John dryden

You'll be sending your brain a new message and commanding new results. You will be demanding empowering emotions, enriching thoughts, inspiring questions.

A word of caution: Don't begin this ten-day commitment unless and until you are certain that you are going to live by it for the full length of time.

Obstacles
Lazyness:
What stands in the way of just deciding to banish them? Three things really. One is laziness. A lot of people know what they should do, but never quite get up the energy to do it.

Fear:
All too often, the security of a mediocre present is more comfortable than the adventure of trying to be more in the future.

Force of habit:
We all have emotional patterns. the deadening force of routine.

This exercise is a ways to get beyond all three and produce lasting changes with benefits that can multiply over time.

Believe me, the power inherent in this little exercise is amazing. If you stick with it, it will do four things for you. First, it will make you acutely aware of all the habitual mental patterns that hold you back. Second, it will make your brain search for empowering alternatives to them. Third, it will give you an incredible jolt of confidence as you see that you can turn your life around. Fourth, and most importantly, it will create new habits, new standards, and new expectations that will help you expand more than you could ever believe.
