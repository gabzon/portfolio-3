The vocabulary of ultimate success

"a powerful agent is the right word. Whenever we come upon one of those intensely right words... the resulting effect is physical as well as spiritual, and electrically prompt"-Mark twain

Throughout humain history, our greatest leaders and thinkers have used the power of words to transform our emotions, to enlist us in their causes, and to shape the course of destiny. Words can not only create emotions, they create action.

Most of beliefs are formed by words- and they can be changed by words as well.

Realize now the power that your words command if you simply choose them wisely.

The words you habitually choose also affect how you communicate with yourself and therefore what you experience.

People with an impoverished vocabolary live an impoverished emotional life; people with rich vocabularies have a multihued palette of colors with which to paint their experience, not only for others, but for themselves as well.

Simply by changing your habitual vocabulary-the words you consistently use to describe the emotions of your life-your can instantaneously change hoy you think, how you feel, and how you live.

Behaviors obviously reflected their beliefs
Transformational vocabulary

This is the essence of transformational vocabulary: the words that we attach to our experience become our experience.

Since words are our primary tool for interpretation or translation, the way we label our experience immediately changes the sensations produced in our nervous systems. You and I must realize that words do indeed create a biochemical effect.

"words form the thread on which we string our experiences." - Aldous Huxley

Our habitual vocabulary is extremely limited.

If we want to change our lives and shape our destiny, we need to consciously select the words we're going to use, and we need to constantly strive to expand our level of choice.

Linguist have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that culturally we're shaped by our language. Doesn't it make sense that the english language is so verb-oriented? After all, as a culture we're very active and pride ourselves on our focus of talking action.

Thus, it's important to realize that words shape our beliefs and impact our actions.

"Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men"-Confucius

It is possible that by adopting someone else's habitual vocabulary, you began to adopt their emotional pattern as well

"In the beginning was the word..."-John1:1

THE WORDS YOU CONSISTENTLY SELECT WILL SHAPE YOUR DESTINY

If you don't have a way of representing something, you can't experience it.

Being depressed is the closest thing to being dead.

If an assemblage of words you're using is creating states that disempower you, get rid of those words and replace them with those that empower you!

Transformational vocabulary breaks unresourceful patterns, makes us smile, produces totally different feelings, changes our states, and allows us to ask more intelligent questions.

YOU CAN USE TRANSFORMATIONAL VOCABULARY TO HELP OTHERS

The words we use as a corporate culture and as individuals have a profound effect on our experience of reality

From tinkled to turbo-charged

TODO: Take a moment right now, and write down three words that you currently use on a regular basis to make yourself feel lousy (bored, frustrated, disappointed, angry, humiliated, hurt, sad, and so forth) Whatever words you choose, be sure they are ones that you use regularly to disempower yourself. To discover some of the words you need to transform, ask yourself, "What are some negative feelings I have on a consistent basis?"

Next, having identified these three words, have some fun. Put yourself in a crazy and outrageous state and brainstorm some new words that you think you could use to either break your pattern or at least lower your emotional intensity in some way.

Remember that your brain loves anything that gets you out of pain and into pleasure.
